# Cluedo Top Secret Passcodes

You need to print out your passwords because you can never remember then? Be smart and use this tool to make them totally safe to print out.

An adversary can never read your secret passcodes because it's only possible if you have a red magnifying glass, like in the board game Cluedo.
